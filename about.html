          <p>I'm Herbert, the guy behind the picture on the home page. I live in Genk, located in the province of Limburg.</p>
          <p>Fun fact: people from Limburg are often slower talkers, making it seem like they are a little bit slow in the brain.
          Rest assured, when we start working together, you will (hopefully) find out that I'm doing ok in this regard.</p>
          <p>This is my first webpage ever that I've built from scratch.
            I don't really consider this to be a top-class product, you will probably find some things within my code that
            could be improved. (like the width on my content container, for example.)</p>

          <h2>My topic</h2>
          <p>I like puzzling! So I've made a puzzle for you (dont think too much about it, though).</p>
          <img src="img/puzzle.jpg" alt="puzzle"/>
          <p>I've picked up a bit of JavaScript in the meanwhile,
            so I've used some JavaScript to create a secret message. The goal is to find the secret message within the link below.<p
          <p>You'll see that it's a combination of some form elements and some JavaScript in it. Go ahead and try to figure it out!</p>

      <footer>
        This is where I would put a nice footer. I didn't have time to finish this yet though.
